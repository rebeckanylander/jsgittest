<h1>Circle</h1>
<p>Circle is a very exciting movie about 30 strangers who are forced to kill each other off. While I don't remember the ending of the movie, apparently that was very confusing.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I enjoyed Circle was that it experimented with the human psyche and what you would be willing to do under pressure.</p>
